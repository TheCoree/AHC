### AHC - ASCII Hyper Coder: Overview

AHC - ASCII Hyper Coder is an encryption tool designed to transform text into a secure, encoded format using ASCII values and numerical mixing. This tool allows users to specify parameters (`mixing` and `key`) to customize the encryption process, ensuring the encoded text is unique and challenging to decode without the correct settings.

#### Features:
- ASCII Conversion: Converts text characters into their corresponding ASCII values.
- Numerical Mixing: Adds a specified numeric value (`mixing`) to each ASCII value for encryption.
- Key Integration: Appends a numeric key to further modify the ASCII values during encryption.
- Decryption Capability: Supports decryption using extracted mixing and key parameters from encrypted text.
- File Handling: Includes functionality to save both original and encrypted messages to a file (`coded.txt`).

#### Usage:
1. Encryption: Enter text, mixing, and key parameters to encrypt messages.
2. Decryption: Provide encrypted text to retrieve the original message using extracted parameters.

#### Instructions:
- Start: Launch the program and follow on-screen prompts.
- Commands: Use `code` for encryption and `decode` for decryption.
- Parameters: Ensure mixing and key values are between 1 and 9 for effective encryption.

#### Security Note:
- Customize mixing and key parameters for enhanced security and uniqueness of encrypted messages.

AHC - ASCII Hyper Coder provides a straightforward yet effective approach to securing textual data through customizable encryption techniques.
